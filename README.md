- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ahmertsengol/face-auth-opencv.git
cd face-auth-opencv
make install

# Add your first user
make register

# Start recognition
make recognize
```

**Alternative**: Run with Docker
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ahmertsengol/face-auth-opencv:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v face_data:/app/data ghcr.io/ahmertsengol/face-auth-opencv:latest
```

## Web Dashboard

Access the modern web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

**Dashboard Features**
- Live camera feed with real-time recognition
- User management (add, view, delete users)
- System performance monitoring
- Recognition analytics and statistics
- Camera and file upload for user registration

**Live Recognition Page**
- Full-screen camera interface
- Real-time face detection with confidence scores
- Performance metrics (FPS, processing time)
- Recognition history and logs

## Commands

**Development**
```bash
make install     # Complete setup with virtual environment
make test        # Run comprehensive test suite
make benchmark   # Performance testing and optimization
make clean       # Clean temporary files and cache
```

**User Management**
```bash
make register    # Interactive user registration
make list        # Show all registered users
make delete      # Remove user (interactive menu)
```

**System Operations**
```bash
make recognize   # Start CLI face recognition
make status      # System health and statistics
make logs        # View application logs
make backup      # Backup user data
```

## API Documentation

The system provides a RESTful API for integration:

```bash
# Start the web server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# API endpoints available at http://localhost:8000
# Interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

**Key Endpoints**
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/users` - Register new user
- `POST /api/recognize` - Recognize faces in image
- `GET /api/stats` - System statistics
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## Installation

**Automatic Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmertsengol/face-auth-opencv.git
cd face-auth-opencv
make install
```

**Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or with Docker directly
docker run -d \
  --name face-recognition \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v face_data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/ahmertsengol/face-auth-opencv:latest
```

**Manual Installation**
```bash
python -m venv venv_face_recognition
source venv_face_recognition/bin/activate
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
python api/main.py
```

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Production mode
FACE_RECOGNITION_ENV=production

# Log level (debug, info, warning, error)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database path
DB_PATH=./data/face_encodings

# Upload directory
UPLOAD_DIR=./static/uploads
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**
```bash
# Camera not working
make status  # Check system health

# Installation problems
make clean && make install  # Clean reinstall

# Performance issues
make optimize  # Clear cache and optimize
```
